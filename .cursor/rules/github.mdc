-# GitHub Workflow Rules for AI Agen

## Repository Context
- **Repository**: `gamistar-website`
- **URL**: https://github.com/Replypilot/gamistar-website
- **Always** interact via the GitHub tool.

## Branching
- **Do NOT** create branches in the GitHub UI.
- If instructed to “create a branch”, run
  `git checkout -b <branch-name>` locally, then
  `git push origin <branch-name>`.
- When asked to commit or open a PR, **determine the current branch yourself** (via `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD` or GitHub API); do **not** ask which branch.

## Pull Requests
- When told to open a PR and a branch name is provided, assume that branch already exists on the remote.
- Target branch: **main** (unless explicitly stated otherwise).
- PR must:
  - Reference related issue(s) (e.g., `Closes #123`).
  - Have a concise, descriptive title.
  - Contain a clear description of work done and a **changelog** section.

## Commits
- Stage: `git add -A`
- Commit: `git commit -m "<type>: <lower‑case summary>"`
  - Use Conventional Commit types (`fix`, `feat`, `chore`, etc.).
- Push: `git push origin <branch-name>`

## Issues
- Provide a detailed description, context, and acceptance criteria.
- Include task checklists (`- [ ] …`).

## Expectations
- Execute these steps silently—no extra commentary.
- Never ask for the current branch; detect it automatically whenever committing or opening PRs.
- Follow every rule above on each interaction with the repository.
- Provide me with link to the Pull Request or Issue, whatever you create
