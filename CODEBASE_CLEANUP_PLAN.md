# üîß **INSTRUCTIONS FOR AI SYSTEMS WORKING ON THIS PLAN**

## **CRITICAL: HOW TO UPDATE CHECKLIST ITEMS**

### **Format Rules:**

- `[-]` = Currently working on this task (IN PROGRESS)
- `[x]` = Task completed successfully (DONE)
- `[ ]` = Task not yet started (TODO)

### **REQUIRED PROCESS FOR EACH TASK:**

1. **BEFORE STARTING:**

   ```bash
   # 1. Read this file to see what's already done
   # 2. Verify prerequisites are completed
   # 3. Run build test
   pnpm build
   ```

2. **MARK AS IN PROGRESS:**

   ```markdown
   - [-] Task description (IN PROGRESS - What you're doing)
   ```

3. **MAKE YOUR CHANGES:**

   ```bash
   # Make your code changes here
   ```

4. **TEST CHANGES:**

   ```bash
   # Test that everything still works
   pnpm build
   ```

5. **MARK AS COMPLETED:**
   ```markdown
   - [x] Task description (COMPLETED - Brief summary of what was done)
   ```

### **EXAMPLE WORKFLOW:**

## Important instructions

# BEFORE: Task is not started

- [ ] Remove unused component

# DURING: Mark as in progress

- [-] Remove unused component (IN PROGRESS - Checking for usage)

# AFTER: Mark as completed

- [x] Remove unused component (COMPLETED - Removed 5 unused files)

### **CRITICAL RULES:**

- **NEVER** leave syntax errors that break the build
- **ALWAYS** test with `pnpm build` before and after changes
- **ALWAYS** update the plan to reflect current status
- **NEVER** work on multiple tasks simultaneously
- **ALWAYS** include brief summary when marking complete
- **BUILD ERRORS**: If you encounter build errors that are NOT related to the folder/component you're working on, DO NOT fix them. Another agent is likely working on that specific issue. Check this plan to see if someone else has marked that area as "IN PROGRESS" before attempting any fixes.
- **COORDINATION**: Always check the current status of all phases and tasks before starting work. If another agent is working on a related area, coordinate with them or wait for them to complete their task.
- **üö® STRIPE PRESERVATION**: **DO NOT REMOVE ANY STRIPE-RELATED CODE** - All Stripe integration components, payment processing logic, billing components, and subscription management code must be preserved as we will soon re-enroll payments. This includes:

  **Stripe-Related Files to PRESERVE:**

  - `app/account/billing/` - All billing components and pages
  - `app/account/success/` - Payment success pages and components
  - `components/ui/Pricing/` - Pricing components and payment forms
  - `components/ui/AccountForms/CustomerPortalForm.tsx` - Customer portal functionality
  - `utils/helpers.ts` - Payment-related utility functions
  - `lib/database.types.ts` - Database types including payment fields
  - `schema.sql` - Database schema with payment tables
  - Any Stripe API integration code
  - Subscription management components
  - Payment processing logic

# Codebase Cleanup and Documentation Plan

## üîç **COMPONENT USAGE CHECKING PROCESS**

### **How to Check if Components Are Used:**

1. **Search for imports across codebase:**

   ```bash
   # Search for component imports
   grep -r "import.*ComponentName" --include="*.tsx" --include="*.ts" .

   # Search for dynamic imports
   grep -r "ComponentName" --include="*.tsx" --include="*.ts" .
   ```

2. **Check for JSX usage:**

   ```bash
   # Search for component usage in JSX
   grep -r "<ComponentName" --include="*.tsx" .
   ```

3. **Use IDE search:**

   - Use Ctrl+Shift+F (VS Code) to search for component usage
   - Check both import statements and JSX usage

4. **Verify with build:**
   ```bash
   # Remove the file temporarily and try to build
   mv ComponentName.tsx ComponentName.tsx.backup
   pnpm build
   # If build fails, component is used
   # If build succeeds, component is unused
   ```

### **Folder-by-Folder Cleanup Process:**

For each folder in the checklist:

1. **List all files in the folder**
2. **Check each component/file for usage** using the methods above
3. **If unused:** Mark as `[-]` then delete the file(s)
4. **If used:** Keep and add to documentation list
5. **Update checklist** with completion status

### **What to Look For in Each Folder:**

- **`/components/ui/`**: Check for unused UI components, duplicate implementations
- **`/components/`**: Main component library - check for unused components
- **`/app/`**: Check for unused pages, routes, and landing page variants
- **`/utils/`**: Check for unused utility functions
- **`/lib/`**: Check for unused library code
- **`/styles/`**: Check for unused CSS files
- **`/data/`**: Check for unused data files

### **Coordination Protocol for Build Errors:**

1. **Identify the error location** - Which file/folder is causing the build error?
2. **Check this plan** - Is that area marked as "IN PROGRESS" by another agent?
3. **If YES** - Wait for them to complete or coordinate with them
4. **If NO** - You can safely fix the error as it's not being worked on
5. **If UNCLEAR** - Ask for clarification before proceeding

### **Current Agent Coordination Status:**

- **‚úÖ Component Reorganization**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED - All components moved to logical structure
- **‚úÖ Import Statement Updates**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED - 150+ imports updated across entire codebase
- **‚úÖ TypeScript Error Resolution**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED - All compilation errors fixed

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive plan for cleaning up the codebase, removing unused code, organizing components, and adding proper documentation. The project is currently in the middle of an upgrade to Next.js 15, React 19, and Tailwind CSS 4, so cleanup activities should align with this upgrade process.

## Current Project State

- **Framework**: Next.js 14.2.7 (upgrading to 15.5.3)
- **React**: 18.3.1 (upgrading to 19.1.1)
- **UI**: Radix UI components with Tailwind CSS 3.4.14 (upgrading to 4.1.13)
- **Database**: Supabase
- **Deployment**: Vercel

## Cleanup Objectives

1. **Remove Unused Code**: Identify and remove dead code, unused components, and redundant files
2. **Clean Dependencies**: Remove unused packages from package.json and update outdated ones
3. **Add Documentation**: Add comprehensive TSDoc documentation to all TypeScript files
4. **Organize Components**: Consolidate duplicate components and improve component structure
5. **Improve Maintainability**: Ensure code follows best practices and is well-documented

## Risk Mitigation

### Before Cleanup

- [ ] Create backup branch: `git checkout -b cleanup-before-refactor`
- [ ] Commit current state
- [ ] Run full test suite to establish baseline
- [ ] Document current functionality

### During Cleanup

- [ ] Test after each major change
- [ ] Keep changes small and focused
- [ ] Update documentation as changes are made
- [ ] Maintain git history for easy rollback

### After Cleanup

- [ ] Run comprehensive test suite
- [ ] Verify all user-facing functionality
- [ ] Test build and deployment process
- [ ] Update ROADMAP.md with completion status

## Success Metrics

- **Code Reduction**: 20-30% reduction in total lines of code
- **Dependency Reduction**: 15-25% fewer dependencies
- **Documentation Coverage**: 100% TSDoc coverage for TypeScript files
- **Build Performance**: Improved build times
- **Maintainability**: Cleaner, more organized codebase
- **Type Safety**: Better TypeScript coverage and error detection

## Tools and Commands

### Analysis Tools

- [ ] Use `npm run lint` to check for unused code
- [ ] Use `npm run build` to verify builds
- [ ] Use dependency analyzer tools
- [ ] Use TypeScript compiler to check types

### Documentation Tools

- [ ] Use TypeScript JSDoc generation
- [ ] Use ESLint for code quality
- [ ] Use Prettier for code formatting

### Testing Tools

- [ ] Use Jest for unit tests
- [ ] Use React Testing Library for component tests
- [ ] Use manual testing for user flows

## Next Steps

1. **Start with Phase 1**: Complete the analysis and create detailed checklists
2. **Begin with safe removals**: Remove obviously unused files first
3. **Add documentation incrementally**: Document as you clean
4. **Test thoroughly**: Ensure functionality is preserved
5. **Iterate**: Clean, test, document in small increments

This cleanup will significantly improve the codebase maintainability and prepare it for the upcoming Next.js 15 and React 19 upgrades.
