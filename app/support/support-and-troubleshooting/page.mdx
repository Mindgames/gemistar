  <summary><strong>Why are responses not generating in the Brave browser?</strong></summary>

The Brave browser’s **shield** feature may block the extension from working correctly.  

To fix this:  
1. Click the Brave **shield icon** in the address bar.  
2. Toggle the shield off for the site you’re using.  
3. Refresh the page.  

After disabling the shield, Gamistar should generate responses normally.
