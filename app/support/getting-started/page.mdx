**Availability:** The extension is currently **invitation only**.

### Steps
1. **Find your invite** — Open the **“Access Granted”** email from the Gamistar team.
2. **Open the Web Store link** — Click the link in the email to go directly to the Chrome web store.
3. **Install** — Click **Add to Chrome**, then **Add extension** to confirm.
4. **Verify** — The Gamistar icon appears in your Chrome toolbar. *(Optional: pin it for quick access.)*

### Notes

- If you haven’t received an invite, please **join the waitlist** or contact **support@gamistar.com**.

  <summary><strong>How do I use Gamistar?</strong></summary>

You can launch Gamistar right inside the chat windows of your browser.

### Quick Start
1. **Open a site** with a text box (e.g., a chat or comment field).
2. **Launch Gamistar** — Click the Gamistar icon that appears near the text box *(or use the toolbar icon if you don’t see it)*.
3. **Generate** — Open the panel, adjust options if needed, and generate a draft.
4. **Review & insert** — Edit if necessary, then insert the response into your message. *You stay in control of what’s sent.*

### Troubleshooting
- **Don’t see the icon?** Refresh the page, ensure the extension is enabled at `chrome://extensions`, and confirm you’re using a supported Chromium desktop browser.
- **Panel won’t open?** Toggle the toolbar icon once, or restart Chrome.

  <summary><strong>Can I use Gamistar on multiple devices?</strong></summary>

Yes. Gamistar is a Chrome extension, so you can install it on any **desktop or laptop** that supports Chrome.  
Simply sign in to Chrome with your Google account and install the Gamistar extension.

You can repeat the installation on as many Chrome browsers as you like — **no extra setup required**.

> **Note:** Chrome extensions aren’t supported on mobile browsers, so Gamistar is currently available on **desktop only**.
