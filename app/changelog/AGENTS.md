# Changelog Authoring Guide

Use this guide when generating new changelog entries for Gamistar.

- **Audience:** end users and teams running the Gamistar Chrome extension. Assume they rely on Gamistar to manage conversations, not on internal implementation details.
- **Tone:** clear, confident, and product-focused. Describe outcomes and user benefits first, then mention implementation choices only when they help a user understand the impact.
- **Structure:** follow the existing format—metadata, “What’s new,” “Why it matters,” “Try it out,” and “Behind the scenes.” Keep sections scannable with short paragraphs or bullets.
- **Language:** avoid marketing fluff or colloquial phrases. Prefer precise verbs like “enables,” “improves,” “streamlines.” Do not reference internal services, infrastructure, or documentation links unless users must take action.
- **Call to action:** highlight any steps users should take inside the Chrome extension or their connected channels. If no action is required, state that the change is automatic.
- **Consistency:** mirror the casing used across existing entries (`v0.5`, lowercase headings in badges) and keep version references consistent between badges, metadata, and body text.

These notes apply to all future changelog updates unless the product team specifies otherwise.
